# Stackable Monster Musk Effects

Allows you to use multiple Monster Musks at the same time for more effectiveness.

Using one Monster Musk in the base game will double the spawn rate of monsters but using more only lengthens the amount of time.  This mod allows you to use more Monster Musks to increase the spawn rate of monsters further.  If you use two Monster Musks, you will have a 3x spawn rate, three Monster Musks is 4x spawn rate, etc.  Each Monster Musk stack is counted independently.  The buff icon will display a number showing the multiplier for the spawn rate of monsters, not the number of Monster Musks used.  The timer in the tooltip of the buff icon shows the time remaining for the most recently used Monster Musk, which is usually also the last stack to expire.  Monster Musk in the base game does not affect some Calico Statue effects during the Desert Festival, but this mod will.  There is a maximum multiplier after which using more Monster Musks does not have an effect, it can vary but is usually at least 16x.

## Config Options
Multiplicative - Should be true or false.  Default: false.  Setting this to true will cause the spawn rate to be increased multiplicatively.  Using two Monster Musks will result in a 4x spawn rate, three Monster Musks results in 8x, four Monster Musks results in 16x, etc.
