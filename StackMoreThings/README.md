# Stack More Things

Mod that allows you to stack things like furniture, tackle, clothing, etc. Also lets you adjust the maximum stack size for everything, merge crops of different colors into one stack, and reduce the quality of items so they can be stacked.

Multiplayer has been reported as working.

## Config Options
Supports Generic Mod Config Menu

* MaxStackSize - adjust the maximum stack size for all items (default 9999)
* EnableComplexPatches - enables changes that allow for correct handling of tackle usage, furniture placement, forging, tailoring, etc. This should usually be turned on, but if you encounter bugs, turn this off.

There is one option for each of the previously unstackable things and are all enabled by default:
* Boots
* Clothing
* Furniture
* Hats
* Weapons
* Rings
* Tackle
* Tools
* Trinkets
* Wallpaper

Two keybinds for merging colors and reducing quality:
* ColorMergeKey - default F10
* QualityReduceKey - default F9

Hold down these keys while organizing your inventory and chests to merge all colors of one crop into one so they can be stacked, or to reduce the quality of everything to none so they can be stacked.

## Expected Behavior
Some notes on expected behavior:
* Things that do not stack:
  * Dressers and fish tanks with things inside
  * Combined rings made of different rings
  * Weapons and tools with different enchantments
  * Fishing rods that can have bait or tackle
  * Clothing of different color
  * Different colors of Cornucopia bell peppers (this may change in the future)
* You can wear multiple rings and boots, but the effects will not stack
* Tackle will prioritize being placed on empty tackle spots if there are any
