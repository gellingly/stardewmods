# Adjust Explosion Speed

Mod that allows you to adjust how quickly a bomb takes to explode after being placed.

Likely to be incompatible with multiplayer.

## Config Options
Supports Generic Mod Config Menu

There is a multipler for each of the three types of bombs (Cherry Bomb, Bomb, and Mega Bomb). 0 for instant, 0.5 to halve the time, 1 for no change, 2 for twice as fast, etc.

If you have [Iridium Bombs](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/26476) installed, there additional multipliers for those bombs as well.
